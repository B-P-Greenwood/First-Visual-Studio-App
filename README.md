# First-Visual-Studio-App

An app to learn the basics for visual studio, c#, .net and Bootstrap.

I will create a Jokes API with full CRUD routes which is available for signed up users.

<div  align="center">
<img src="./Jokes/wwwroot/Images/1zvw_ahkc_210729.jpg" width='200'/>
</div>
</br>
Users who have singed up can add, edit and delete their own jokes. Users, both signed up and anonymous are only able to view other users jokes.
